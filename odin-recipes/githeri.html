<p> Great recipe for Githeri</p>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups of mixed dried maize and beans (Githeri mix)</li>
    <li>Water for soaking</li>
    <li>2-3 cups of water for cooking</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1-2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
    <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped (optional)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place the mixed dried maize and beans (Githeri mix) in a large bowl and rinse them thoroughly under cold running water.</li>
    <li>Transfer the rinsed Githeri mix to a pot or large saucepan and cover it with water. Allow it to soak for at least 4-6 hours or overnight.</li>
    <li>After soaking, drain the water and rinse the Githeri mix again.</li>
    <li>In the same pot or saucepan, add 2-3 cups of fresh water and bring the Githeri mix to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for about 45 minutes to 1 hour or until the maize and beans are tender but not mushy. Add more water if needed during cooking.</li>
    <li>In a separate pan, heat the cooking oil over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Add the cumin seeds and sauté for a minute or until they start to sizzle and release their aroma.</li>
    <li>Add the chopped onion and garlic to the pan and sauté until they become translucent.</li>
    <li>Stir in the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and the mixture becomes a thick sauce.</li>
    <li>Add the chopped green and red bell peppers (if using) and cook for another 2-3 minutes until they are tender.</li>
    <li>Season the tomato and pepper mixture with paprika, salt, and pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Combine the cooked Githeri mix with the tomato and pepper sauce in the large pot. Mix well and let it simmer together for a few more minutes to meld the flavors.</li>
    <li>Your Githeri is now ready to serve. Enjoy it as is or with some crusty bread!</li>
